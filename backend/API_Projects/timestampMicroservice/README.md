# timestampMicroservice
## Technologies used: HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express
* [freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice)
* [my project on glitch.com](https://hyper-bobcat.glitch.me/)
* User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
* User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
* User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
