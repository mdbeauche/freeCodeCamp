## backend/API_Projects/timestampMicroservice
[freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice)
* User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
* User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
* User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

## backend/API_Projects/urlShortener
[freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/url-shortener-microservice)
* User Story:  I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
* User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
* User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
