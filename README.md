# freeCodeCamp projects

* A listing of some of my completed freeCodeCamp projects.

## frontend/libraries/markdownPreviewer
* [freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)
* [my project on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/mdbeauche/full/yEVYPJ/)
* User Story: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".
* User Story: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".
* User Story: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
* User Story: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
* User Story: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
* User Story: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

## backend/API_Projects/timestampMicroservice
* [freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice)
* [my project on glitch.com](https://hyper-bobcat.glitch.me/)
* User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
* User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
* User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

## backend/API_Projects/requestHeaderParser
* [freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice)
* [my project on glitch.com](https://excited-wizard.glitch.me/)
* User Story: I can get the IP address, language and operating system for my browser.

## backend/API_Projects/urlShortener
* [freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/url-shortener-microservice)
* [my project on glitch.com](https://grateful-tune.glitch.me/)
* User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
* User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
* User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

## backend/API_Projects/imageSearchAbstractionLayer
* [freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/image-search-abstraction-layer)
* [my project on glitch.com](https://tender-warrior.glitch.me/)
* User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
* User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
* User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
